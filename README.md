# tellepet_downsjy_Assignment06
An assignment for Evan's and Jeff's ASP.NET class. <br/>
We wrote a web form to select appropriate information to then be entered into a database that mimics a grocery store
through a stored procedure. <br/>
The assignment grabs appropriate data to select using datasets to auto-populate dropdowns. On submit it adds the selected values into
the stored procedure's parameters collection and runs the stored procedure.
